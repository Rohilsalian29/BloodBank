               effective way to find out the availability of the required blood groups in the blood banks. The project
               is totally built at administrative end and thus only administrator is gauranteed. The purpose of our Blood
               bank mangement system is to simplify and automate the process of searching for blood in case of emergency and
               maintain the records of blood donors who have registered themselves in our system. In our system the donor who 
               wants to donate blood can register himself in our system and his name will be added by admin after he enquire 
               the donor for adding him in system and then the required blood searchers can search the required blood he wanted
